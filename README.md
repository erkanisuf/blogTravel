**Why i did it?**
</br>
Wanted to learn how React application can interact with database . In this case i used Firebase Cloud Database which is NOSQL document based . I also dived in to user registrations and logins with the help of Firebase and it helped me to gain knowledge about auth services. It was abit challenging since i didnt have experiance with any kind of Db and CRUD operations that are connected with it. Also understood that in case we upload files that we need to use Storage . Overall project was a good beginning to dive in to "fullstackish" mode , even tho the app uses the "backend" of firebase. But i think firebase is very usefull tool for front end devs.
